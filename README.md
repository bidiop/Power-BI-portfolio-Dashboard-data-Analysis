Project Overview
This project showcases a comprehensive data analysis workflow for business sales data, using Power BI for data cleaning, modeling, analysis, and visualization. The objective was to build a dashboard highlighting key sales insights across different areas and enabling comparative study and a clear understanding of sales strengths and trends.

Project Steps
1. Data Cleaning & Modeling
   •	Data Cleaning: Power BI's data cleaning features handle missing values, standardize data formats, and correct inconsistencies.
   •	Modeling:
     	- Defined table relationships and ensured correct cardinality to represent data connections accurately.
      - Created dimension tables to provide structure and simplify analysis, making viewing data by different categories easier.
      - Enforced row-level security to control access to sensitive data by user roles.
        
2. DAX Calculations
 	DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):
      - Created calculated tables, columns, and measures using DAX to derive new insights and metrics.
      - Implemented time intelligence functions for period-based comparisons, such as month-over-month or year-over-year growth.
      - Defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to evaluate sales performance across different areas.

3. Data Visualization - Dashboard Creation
     - 	Built a user-friendly Power BI dashboard to visualize critical findings:
     

     - 	Focused on the strength of sales across different regions, identifying high and low-performing areas.
     - 	Conducted comparative analysis to reveal trends, patterns, and insights into sales performance.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Power BI's advanced features, such as DAX calculations, security enforcement, and interactive visuals, can transform raw data into actionable insights, supporting better decision-making. The final dashboard offers a comprehensive view of sales strengths across regions within a product category, segment, and buyer, aiding stakeholders in strategic planning.
Considering the data insight, the recommendation will be to increase sales in specific areas such as Savannah-Georgia by opening New Stores to make products more accessible.
